<p>What exactly is the burger king michael myers build. I�d tell you my build but i�m currently only on. I recently got him and have been really enjoying playing, but i haven’t had the easiest time putting together a proper build. Here�s new build i want to try, but won�t be able to for several months. Build wise, what i use on mine is monitor &amp; abuse, agitation, and whatever perks float your boat for the other two.</p>

<p>Ew1 myers build question so, sometimes i do kyf with some friends, and i�ve been wanting to play around with them using the silent myers build (they don�t play the game much, and don�t know about monitor and abuse). After hooking a survivor, all other survivors� auras are revealed to you for 4 seconds when they are farther than 40 metres from the hook. Hovering over the modifier words with your cursor will reveal the values behind them.on mobile browsers, the values are displayed in small text after the modifier words. You can swap ruin for pop, but i personally prefer ruin. Currently i�m using make your choice, ruin, brutal strength, and fire up, but i do want to hear some other suggestions.</p>
