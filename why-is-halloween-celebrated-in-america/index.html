As you prepare to participate in, or just observe, halloween festivities this year, enjoy the “cultural” experience, spend time with friends, and don’t be afraid to engage in halloween creatively, for good, and not for evil. Each year on 31st october all hallows’ eve is celebrated around the world.this is just a day before all hallows’ day, also known as all saints’ day in the christian calendar. And as the europeans mingled with the native americans, traditions evolved even further.</p>
