<p>Cole sprouse and adam sandler reunited 21 years after the making of their film big daddy. the riverdale star and the comedian met up at the premiere of uncut gems — sandler�s buzzy new film, which sees him play a con man and hustler in new york�s diamond district — in los angeles on wednesday. Except for the adorableness of the boy and the ultimately moral conclusion of the storyline, big daddy is filled with groaner, sickout jokes that are only mildly forgivable because they come. Despite fierce summer competition, the comedy big daddy scored $41.5 million opening weekend. It was released on june 25, 1999.
