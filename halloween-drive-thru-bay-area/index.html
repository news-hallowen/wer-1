<p>These doors lead to small enclaves, aka fairy houses, where people leave letters and small gifts for fairies. A friend of mine sent me the link a couple of weeks ago to sign up for the green bay packers spooktacular drive thru 2020, and after attending today, it did not disappoint. So they opted for a creative alternative: Staff and our amazing sponsors will be passing out candy, arts &amp; crafts, and more! 2020 has been frightening enough, but if you’re craving some more traditional scares rather than, say, a maskless cougher elbowing you at the grocery store, then you might want to check out one of the bay area’s spookiest haunted houses.</p>
