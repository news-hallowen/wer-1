<p>The event was originally planned for september 10th through november 1st in 2020. Resorts world sentosa (rws) announced the cancellation on their facebook page on sep.

Announced ahead of disney, universal has agreed to pay its employees while their theme parks remain closed. Though reports seemed to indicate that construction had previously been going on at universal orlando resort in preparation for universal orlando resort�s annual halloween horror nights (and scareactors were being hired as recently as this past monday), it looks like the resort has made the difficult decision to cancel this year�s event.</p>
