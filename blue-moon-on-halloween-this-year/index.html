<p>Halloween this year will occur on the same night as the full blue moon for the first time since the second world war. The blue moon joins other celestial halloween characters roaming the night sky next saturday evening. It hasn’t happened since 2001. The blue moon on halloween will affect these 4 signs the least the year�s spookiest lunation comes in peace — for some of us, anyway. For the first time since 2001, a blue moon will fall on halloween, making it a halloween blue moon.</p>

<p>What makes it extra special is that while the last blue moon occurred in march 2018, this is the first time it is taking place on halloween in all time zones since 1944. And because the lunar cycle is only 29.5 days long, any full moon that falls on halloween will always be a blue moon. Halloween might offer a brief respite with a naturally occurring phenomenon that rarely happens, much less on all. 1906, 1925, 1944, 1955, 1974, 1993, 2001, 2020, 2039, 2058, 2077, and 2096. The blue moon on halloween will affect these 4 signs the least the year�s spookiest lunation comes in peace — for some of us, anyway.</p>

<p>Typically, the next full moon that follows the harvest moon is called the hunter’s moon. In october 2020, we’re in for a special lunar event: The first occurs on thursday, october 1, and the second occurs on saturday, october 31. I�m glad i have a copy of it�s the great pumpkin, charlie brown to watch too. Get ready for an extraspooky halloween this year, because the astronomical phenomenon known as a blue moon is happening on none other than oct.</p>

<p>I�m glad i have a copy of it�s the great pumpkin, charlie brown to watch too. In fact, this year there will likely be a ‘blue moon,’ according to earthsky. We’ll see two full moons this october: The moon will “be the second of two full moons to occur in a single calendar month,” making it a blue moon, which can also be “the third of four full moons in a single season, with a season being between a solstice and equinox.” A rare blue moon on the night of halloween this year is a prophetic sign of the end of the world, a controversial tv evangelist has announced.</p>

<p>It is a rare phenomenon that occurs every 2 years and only this year, the blue moon will appear on the same day as halloween. It hasn’t happened since 2001. Blue moons that occur on halloween are even rarer. Traditional festivities will look very different this year because of coronavirus. This is where the phrase, “once in a blue moon” comes from.</p>
